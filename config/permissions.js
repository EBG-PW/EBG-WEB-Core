/*
    app_permissions: List all permissions that are native to the application itself.
    All those permissions do not have a read or write part.
    However all those permissions need read & write to be true in order for a user to get them granted!

    There are 2 groups in the panel, reg and member. For example for the events and activities.
    This needs to be represented by a group.member permission. This will grand the member check for the group.
